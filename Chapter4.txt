It was one of the best moments of my Life. I have the Logitech MX Master 2S. Cannot say that I am dissatisfied that I did not get the 3S version, because I never expected an MX Master version mouse before getting a job. So now I have both the MX Mechanical Keyboard and the MX Master 2S Mouse. I could have never imagined a few years before that I would so lucky to have these things.
